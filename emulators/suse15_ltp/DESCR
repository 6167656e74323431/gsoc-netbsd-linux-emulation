Linux compatibility package based on the openSUSE Linux distribution.
Please visit http://www.opensuse.org/ for more information about openSUSE
Linux.

This package supports compiles the Linux Test Project (LTP under NetBSD's Linux
emulation.  It allows for testing NetBSD's Linux emulation with the same tests
used for Linux itself.

LTP is installed in /emul/linux/opt/ltp.  The full test suite can be run by
running

	./runltp

from that directory as root, and the results will be written to the
/emul/linux/opt/ltp/output and /emul/linux/opt/ltp/results directories.

Additionally passing -s PATTERN to ./runltp only runs tests that include PATTERN
in their name.  For example

	./runltp -s wait

runs all tests that include wait in their name.  This includes all the
tests for wait, waitid, epoll_wait, sigwait (and many more).

For a description of all the available options --help can be passed to
./runltp.
